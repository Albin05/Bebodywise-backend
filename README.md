## bebodywise-backend

An express app with MongoDB database which is been used as a backend server for the bebodywise website.

We have implemented functionalities sucha as user authorisation and authentication.

Various Mongoose schemas are created to store the user data in the MongoDB database.

Many CRUD operations are used to achieve many routes to send and recieve data between the client and the server.

We have used various npm packages.

* Bcrypt is use to hash the password before we store it in the database.

* JSON web token is also used to generate a user token which is been sent to the frontend.


We have deployed the app on Heroku.
